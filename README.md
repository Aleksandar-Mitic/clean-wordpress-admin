# Clean WordPress Admin
A collection of functions to clean up WordPress front-end and back-end
to make it easier for editors to work and for you to look at the source code.
Hiding content is also a good thing to do to limit the possibilities for your clients to destroy your beautiful site.


## Content

### Admin menu
Hide items and sub-items in the admin menu. Also known as the Toolbar.

### Clean head
Clears out generated unwanted stuff from the wp_head hook. Such as feeds and WordPress version.

### Contextual tabs
Remove all, remove specific or add new contextual tabs with information about how to use the interface on the current page in the WordPress admin.

### Dashboard
Remove dashboard metaboxes or even the whole dashboard itself.

### Notifications
Remove notifications about core/plugin updates.

### Posts
Remove specific metaboxes from post-types.

### Profile fields
Remove and add fields on the user profile page. Like contact information or the Biographical Info section.

### Capabilities
Remove and add administrating capabilities to specific roles or users. Like preventing user to switch themes or delete others posts.

### WYSIWYG
Remove and add buttons and change the settings of the TinyMCE WYSIWYG.

#### Extras
A pretty personal collection of good, fun and just necessary functions to make WordPress development easier.


## Using
Donâ€™t just include the files in your project and be done. Look at the content, update the options and see what works for you!

 You should probably keep some things visible for you or a super admin. Check the user role like this:
```php
if ( ! current_user_can( 'administrator' ) ) {
  // Clean it up!
}
```

# Clean WordPress Admin
A collection of functions to clean up WordPress front and back-end to make it easier for editors to work and for you to look at the source code. Hiding content is also a good thing to do to limit the possibilities for your clients to destroy your beautiful site :)

## Using
Donâ€™t just include these files in your project. Look at the content, update the options and see what works for you!

 You should probably keep some things visible for you or a super admin. Check the user role like this:
```php
if ( ! current_user_can( 'administrator' ) ) {
  // Clean it up!
}
```
